> Worth noting is that `Sahara Apartments` offers `short term rentals`. This may
> be the best option for `Spring 2018`, since other locations such as `Sol Y Luna`,
> `District on 5th`, and `The Cadence` take applications predominantly in fall, and
> renting an affordable house in Tucson would require more of a long term commitment, which could
> be done after I have learned more about the area.
