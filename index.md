# Options for Housing - Tucson - Spring 2017
1.  [One Bedroom Near UA - $750 - Unfurnished](https://tucson.craigslist.org/apa/d/great-one-bedroom-gh-with/6414756999.html)![Homey](https://images.craigslist.org/00L0L_hhzzYRef8zM_1200x900.jpg)
> One option is to find a `one-bedroom apartment` or `small house` in Tucson,
> away from the `Student Rental Economy`
2. [Sahara Apartments - Lowest Rate on UA Site - One Bedrooms $475+ - Furnished](https://saharaapartments.com/)![Meh](https://saharaapartments.com/wp-content/uploads/photo-gallery/shara-apartments-pool-for-students.jpg)
> Although a bit run-down and sleazy, `Sahara Apartments` does offer
> `incredible rates`, as well as `short-term-rentals`. This could be helpful
> if it seems that we grow fond of an option whose `availability` begins at the
> start of the `Fall 2018 semester`.
3. [Sol y Luna - Prettiest on UA Site - 1 Bedroom apt $1535+ - Room in shared apt $875+ - Furnished](https://www.livesolyluna.com/sol-y-luna-tucson-az/)![Beautiful](https://www.livesolyluna.com/uploads/images/images/original/282460/LEVEL_at_AU_22.jpg?1507855121)
4. [District on 5th - Midrange on UA Site - No 1 Bedrooms - Room in shared apt $690 - $825 - Furnished](http://www.districton5th.com/)![Not Bad](http://www.districton5th.com/~/media/301%20-%20District%20on%205th/Images/301-64-Web.jpg?h=314&w=470&bc=FFFFFF)

> Worth noting is that `Sahara Apartments` offers `short term rentals`. This may
> be the best option for `Spring 2018`, since other locations such as `Sol Y Luna`,
> `District on 5th`, and `The Cadence` take applications predominantly in fall, and
> renting an affordable `house or apartment` in Tucson would require more of a long term commitment, which could
> be done after I have learned more about the area.
